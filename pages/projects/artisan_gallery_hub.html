          Artisangalleryhub is an e-commerce web application designed for
          advertising and selling art products online. The application features
          a user-friendly and responsive design, ensuring an exceptional user
          experience. Throughout this project, I successfully implemented a wide
          range of core features commonly found in e-commerce web applications,
          including user registration and profiles, a comprehensive product
          catalog, a shopping cart, secure payment processing, efficient order
          management, meticulous inventory tracking, powerful search
          functionality, as well as wishlist and favorites management.

        <p class="mt-5 mb-5">
          I have developed a robust search engine equipped with advanced filters
          to assist users in swiftly locating products. Users can effortlessly
          search for products by simply entering keywords, and the system will
          promptly retrieve and display all relevant products. Additionally, the
          system offers a variety of filtering options, allowing users to refine
          their searches based on product price, orientation, size, and
          category.

        <p class="mt-5 mb-5">
          The product cart is among the key features that I have incorporated
          into this project. It enables online customers to effortlessly add
          items for purchase, manage quantities, remove selected items from the
          cart, and view a comprehensive cost summary for all items in the cart.
          Users are then guided to proceed with the checkout process.

          A beautfull designed product page that offers precise information
          about a particular work of art.It provides details such as such as
          size, price, category, similar art works as well as the artist
          responsible for creating that art.

        <p class="mt-5 mb-5">
          I successfully integrated the app with a third-party payment system,
          enabling online payments for customers interested in purchasing
          products on the platform. The checkout page features a billing address
          form, various payment method options, and an order summary that
          details the total cost and the list of selected products for purchase.

          This project encompassed a range of additional features also,
          including data analytics and reporting, social media integration,
          newsletter and email marketing capabilities, scalability enhancements,
          feedback and reviews systems, as well as an administrator panel for
          business management operations.

      Creative Art Box is an e-commerce web application designed for advertising
      and selling art products online. The application features a user-friendly
      and responsive design, ensuring an exceptional user experience. Throughout
      this project, I successfully implemented a wide range of core features
      commonly found in e-commerce web applications, including user registration
      and profiles, a comprehensive product catalog, a shopping cart, secure
      payment processing, efficient order management, meticulous inventory
      tracking, powerful search functionality, as well as wishlist and favorites
      management.

      I have developed a robust search engine equipped with advanced filters to
      assist users in swiftly locating products. Users can effortlessly search
      for products by simply entering keywords, and the system will promptly
      retrieve and display all relevant products. Additionally, the system
      offers a variety of filtering options, allowing users to refine their
      searches based on product price, orientation, size, and category.

      The product cart is among the key features that I have incorporated into
      this project. It enables online customers to effortlessly add items for
      purchase, manage quantities, remove selected items from the cart, and view
      a comprehensive cost summary for all items in the cart. Users are then
      guided to proceed with the checkout process.

      A beautfull designed product page that offers precise information about a
      particular work of art.It provides details such as such as size, price,
      category, similar art works as well as the artist responsible for creating
      that art.

      I successfully integrated the app with a third-party payment system,
      enabling online payments for customers interested in purchasing products
      on the platform. The checkout page features a billing address form,
      various payment method options, and an order summary that details the
      total cost and the list of selected products for purchase.

      data analytics and reporting, social media integration, newsletter and
      email marketing capabilities, scalability enhancements, feedback and
      reviews systems, as well as an administrator panel for business management
      operations.

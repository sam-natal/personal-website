      Vicoba App is an Android mobile application that I have developed
      specifically for village community banks. Its purpose is to streamline and
      manage their activities, ultimately delivering substantial benefits to
      VICOBA, including cost-effectiveness, increased efficiency, and improved
      effectiveness. I designed the app to seamlessly integrate with the
      leadership structure and core operational activities commonly found in
      most village community banks. It offers support for essential tasks, such
      as member management, record-keeping, and a range of transaction
      operations, including fund contributions, share purchases, loan requests,
      and debt payments.

      Moreover, the app support the leadership structure comprising a
      chairperson, accountant, and secretary. Another notable features of the
      App is its integration with third-party digital money systems to enable
      users to securely make money transaction directly from the app,
      eliminating the need for manual transactions involving physical cash or
      vulnerable storage methods.
